- Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
- Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
- Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when
reading from the standard input.
- Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character,
except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
- Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the
get_next_line() function.
- Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file.

• Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your
compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
It will define the buffer size for read().
The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette
in order to test your code.
We must be able to compile this project with and without the -D
BUFFER_SIZE flag in addition to the usual flags. You can choose the
default value of your choice.
• You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example):
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
• We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to
by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didn’t reach the
end of file.
• We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading
a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if
you want to.
